Temporal (wavelet 1D, 2D, sinc 1D, 2D) parametrized filters for EEGNet, Spatial Net, FBCSP, etc.  
class Temporal Filter is universal for Wavelet 1D, 2D, Sinc 1D, 2D, and is parametrized by low freq only. 
Wavelets ans Sincs are parametrized in subsequent classes, where the temporal parameter is SCALE. 
In EEG_Models files the models are tested and compared through various methods.
